# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that provides valuable context but is no longer actively maintained.

## Structure

- **planning/** - Historical planning documents and roadmaps
- **releases/** - Release notes and version-specific documentation
- **process/** - Process guides and publishing workflows
- **completed/** - Documentation for completed work (quality reviews, testing)

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- `/README.md` - User documentation
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Development guide
- `/OPTIMIZATION_RULES.md` - Evidence-based optimization rules
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `/FAQ.md` - Frequently asked questions
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `/docs/PERFORMANCE_TUNING.md` - Performance configuration
- `/docs/PYTHON.md` - Python bindings guide

## Archival Policy

Documents are archived when:
- Work is completed (e.g., Phase 4 planning after Phase 4 ships)
- Processes are one-time (e.g., PyPI publishing guides)
- Information is superseded by newer documentation
- Historical context is valuable but not actively referenced
