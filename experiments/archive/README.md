# Experiments Archive

This directory contains completed experiments that provided valuable insights but are no longer active.

## Archived Experiments

All archived experiments follow the complete scientific method documentation:
- PROPOSAL.md - Initial hypothesis and methodology
- RESEARCH_LOG.md - Detailed investigation process
- FINDINGS.md or GO_DECISION.md - Final results and decision
- Supporting materials (benchmarks, prototypes, analysis)

## Why Archive?

Experiments are archived when:
- Research phase is complete (GO or NO-GO decision made)
- Findings have been integrated into the main codebase or documented
- Historical context is valuable but active work has concluded

## Active Experiments

For active experiments, see: `/experiments/`
